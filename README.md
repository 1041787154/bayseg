[![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL%20v3-blue.svg)]()

A Python library for unsupervised clustering of n-dimensional data based on a combination of Hidden Markov Random Fields,
Gaussian Mixture Models and Bayesian inference. The algorithm is based on the work of
 [Wang et al., 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11004-016-9663-9). It currently supports 1-dimensional
 physical space and is in an early development stage.
